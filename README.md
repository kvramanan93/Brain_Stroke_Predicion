## Stroke Prediction App ðŸ§ 

This is a Streamlit web application that predicts the likelihood of a stroke based on various health parameters such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and more. The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model saved in a .pkl file to make predictions.

## Overview
This project implements a stroke prediction system where users can input personal health data to determine their risk of having a stroke. The system uses Pre-trained models like `SVM`, `RandomForest` and `K-NearestNeighbours` saved in a .pkl file for inference and deployed it on Streamlit.

## Features

* User Input: Allows users to input health data such as age, gender, BMI, and more.
* Stroke Prediction: Uses pretrained machine learning models to predict the risk of stroke.
* Categorical Feature Encoding: Uses `LabelEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder` for categorical data.
* Model Handling: Loads a `.pkl` model for efficient inference.

## Potential Issues and Solutions
* Mismatch Between Input and Model Columns: 
    - Issue: The input data had different feature names (e.g., gender, work_type) than the one-hot encoded features expected by the model (e.g., gender_1, work_type_1).
    - Solution: The input data was manually transformed using `LabelEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder` to match the `one-hot encoded` feature names used during training.
* Incorrect Input Shape for Prediction: 
    - Issue: The input shape for prediction didn't match the format expected by the model (due to one-hot encoding).
    - Solution: The input features were encoded using `OneHotEncoder` inside a `ColumnTransformer`, ensuring that the input format was compatible with the trained model.
